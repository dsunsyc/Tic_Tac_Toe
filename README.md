## Installation:
This project has been tested on python3.6. Once you clone the repo, it should require no external dependencies in a working python3.6 environment. If having issues with Tkinter, try installing xming or equivalent to display gui.  

## Goal: 
Create functional multiplayer and single player Tic-Tac-Toe with multiple levels of AI using minimax algorithms. 

## Improvements:
Considering using alpha-beta pruning, although it wouldn't substantially optimize performance. Refactor the GUI code, bulky and unorganized. Make the bot have a delay after the user's move is displayed. Have options to view the search algorithm being carried out. 

## Credits:
front_end.py file was based on the code by user131127 on https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/155692/simple-tic-tac-toe-using-tkinter
